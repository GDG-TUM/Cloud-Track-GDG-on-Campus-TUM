# Week 2: Tools of the trade

**Date:** 19 Oct (draft; confirm time and venue in the track channel)

**Goal:** Get comfortable with Linux, Git and Docker.

## Learning objectives
By the end you should be able to:
- Navigate the command line
- Create a branch, commit and open a pull request
- Build and run a Docker container

## Before the session
- [ ] Git, an editor and Docker installed (see [Getting Started](../../GETTING-STARTED.md))
- [ ] Read [Stage 2](../../learning-path/02-tools.md)

## Agenda
1. Linux command line essentials (25 min)
2. Git and GitHub workflow (30 min)
3. Docker basics: image, container, Dockerfile (30 min)
4. Q&A (5 min)

## Hands-on reference
```bash
# Git flow for your first contribution
git clone <your-fork-url>
git checkout -b add-profile-yourname
git add .
git commit -m "docs: add my profile"
git push origin add-profile-yourname

# Docker basics
docker run hello-world
docker ps -a
```

## 🏁 Take-home challenge
- [ ] **Make your first pull request:** add your profile in [`members/`](../../members/README.md)
- [ ] Write a Dockerfile for a tiny web app and run it locally
- [ ] Remove the container and image when you finish

Post your result or questions in the track channel, or open an issue.
